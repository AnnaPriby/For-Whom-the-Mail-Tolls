        I''m writing you because I''ve been going
        through our schedules and I haven''t seen your availability written down
        yet. Is it a mistake on my end or have you not set it again? x)


        Also,
        I''m so sorry about that photo of your puppster. I have no idea what happened
        to it or why others always hated looking at it to begin with. I mean, I''ve
        almost come to enjoy that hideousness of his lol.


        Anyway, have
        a nice day,

        Jessica xx'

        I just remembered, have you heard about the project that management is about
        to give out tomorrow?\n\nI thought it would be right up your alley since
        how you've been talking about the surgery your pup needs. And God knows he
        needs it. :(\n\nTime to work hard, eh? Only one of us can get it afterall.

        a bad state and needs that surgery, and something's got to give... We can't
        all pretend to be an angel.\U0001F607\n\nCome to think of it, our management
        has been talking about a project they might give out to one of us. Maybe
        an opportunity to get the money needed? I like my chances personally, but
        thought it wouldn't hurt if I told you as well. :)\n\nKind regards,\nJessica"

        I see how it is. Well in that case you surely won''t
        mind once I get the project that management is gonna be giving out to one
        of us tomorrow.


        Such a shame that you won''t be able to afford
        the surgery you wanted so much for that rat. You can''t even go outside with
        him anymore... But alas.


        Do as you think. x)


        See ya,

        to. This inconsistency isn't a great look. (just helping you out here!)\n\nThis

        have any idea what the fuck is going on. \r\n\r\nBut rest assured the management
        won't look at such behavior fondly once they find out one way or the other..\r\n\r\nKind

        the availability is still not done. Your lazy ass
        will once again be your undoing, like the Panama debacle. Management is still
        shaking off the damages you''ve done there, 10 years later...


        If
        you for once tried something more than being useless and tending to that
        abomination that you call a dog, then maybe you''d be well off by now. Can''t
        let you slow me down now.


        You''ve always been a sucker.


        See
        ya from the top,

        Jess'

        I''ve thought about your outbursts in the
        last few minutes and I''ve come to realize, that they are beneath us both.


        I''d
        like to extend my hand and give you the opportunity to squash this superfluous
        beef between us. I think it will benefit us both if we both act like adults.


        What
        do you think? Would that be possible for you? If so let me know after the
        lunch.


        Kind regards,
